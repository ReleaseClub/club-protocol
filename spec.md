title: Club Protocol v1
description: An on-chain protocol for collective identity and curation.

## Abstract

The Club Protocol v1 provides a modular set of smart contract implementations
for collective management of a shared identity and content with a focus on
curation-based projects. Permissionless and gas-efficient factory contracts are
used to deploy minimal, non-upgradeable, proxies of the provided smart contract
implementations.

This spec is modelled after the [Sound Protocol 2.0 spec](https://github.com/soundxyz/sound-protocol/blob/2be55b0e605af6c9b2b744a10fc7199bbe6e1752/spec.md).
